# üîç How to Find App URL Configuration in Shopify Custom App

## You're in the Wrong Section!

### What You're Currently In:
**Admin API integration** - Only for selecting scopes
- ‚úÖ Choose scopes: `read_products`, `read_product_listings`
- ‚ùå No URL configuration here

### Where to Find URL Configuration:

## Step 1: Look for Different Tabs/Sections

In your Custom App, look for these tabs/sections:

### Option A: "App setup" Tab
- Look for a tab called **"App setup"** or **"Setup"**
- This contains the URL configuration

### Option B: "Configuration" Tab  
- Look for a tab called **"Configuration"**
- This has App URL and redirect URL settings

### Option C: "App URLs" Section
- Look for a section called **"App URLs"** or **"URLs"**
- This is where you set the URLs

## Step 2: What to Look For

In the correct section, you should see fields like:

**App URL:**
```
https://wholesale-cdlp-git-main-cdlps-projects.vercel.app/app
```

**Allowed redirection URL(s):**
```
https://wholesale-cdlp-git-main-cdlps-projects.vercel.app/auth/callback
```

## Step 3: If You Can't Find It

### Try These Locations:

1. **Main App Settings:**
   - Look at the top level of your Custom App
   - Not in Admin API integration

2. **App Details:**
   - Click on the app name/title
   - Look for URL settings

3. **Different View:**
   - Try switching between different views
   - Some sections might be collapsed

## Step 4: Screenshot and Share

If you still can't find it:
1. Take a screenshot of your Custom App interface
2. Show me all the tabs/sections available
3. I can guide you to the exact location

## What You Should See:

### In Admin API integration (current):
- Scopes selection ‚úÖ
- No URLs ‚ùå

### In App setup/Configuration (target):
- App URL field ‚úÖ
- Redirect URL field ‚úÖ
- Save button ‚úÖ

## Common Locations:

- **Apps** ‚Üí **App and sales channel settings** ‚Üí **Develop apps** ‚Üí **[Your App]** ‚Üí **App setup**
- **Apps** ‚Üí **App and sales channel settings** ‚Üí **Develop apps** ‚Üí **[Your App]** ‚Üí **Configuration**
- **Apps** ‚Üí **App and sales channel settings** ‚Üí **Develop apps** ‚Üí **[Your App]** ‚Üí **URLs**

The URL configuration is definitely there somewhere - we just need to find the right tab/section!
