# ðŸ”— Correct OAuth URL

## Fixed Redirect URI Issue

The problem was that `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` was not set in Vercel, causing the redirect_uri to be `undefined`.

## Correct OAuth URL

Use this URL to install the app:

```
https://cdlpstore.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=6393b08a5dbb1fcb9703cbd476c8f8e1&scope=read_products%2Cread_product_listings&redirect_uri=https%3A//wholesale-cdlp-git-main-cdlps-projects.vercel.app/auth/callback
```

## What Was Fixed

1. **Fallback URL**: Added hardcoded fallback URL in case environment variable is missing
2. **Consistent redirect_uri**: Both auth.ts and callback route now use the same URL
3. **URL encoding**: Proper URL encoding for the redirect_uri parameter

## Environment Variables to Set in Vercel

Make sure these are set in your Vercel project:

```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=6393b08a5dbb1fcb9703cbd476c8f8e1
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_admin_api_token_here
DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_database_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://wholesale-cdlp-git-main-cdlps-projects.vercel.app
```

## Installation Steps

1. **Deploy the fix** (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. **Use the correct OAuth URL** above
3. **Authorize the app** in Shopify
4. **Complete OAuth flow** and get redirected to dashboard

## What Should Happen

1. âœ… OAuth authorization page loads correctly
2. âœ… "Install app" button works
3. âœ… Redirect to app with proper callback URL
4. âœ… Shop data saved in database
5. âœ… Dashboard accessible with product data

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting redirect_uri error:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Wait for Vercel deployment (2-3 minutes)
3. Use the exact URL provided above
4. Check that Custom App redirect URL matches in Shopify Admin

### Custom App Configuration:
Make sure in Shopify Admin â†’ Apps â†’ App and sales channel settings â†’ Develop apps â†’ Your app â†’ Configuration:

**App URL:**
```
https://wholesale-cdlp-git-main-cdlps-projects.vercel.app/app
```

**Allowed redirection URL(s):**
```
https://wholesale-cdlp-git-main-cdlps-projects.vercel.app/auth/callback
```
