# üîç Detailed Guide: Finding App URL in Custom Apps

## Based on Shopify Community Feedback

According to the [Shopify Community discussion](https://community.shopify.com/t/cant-find-app-url-in-the-settings-of-a-custom-application/191560/3), finding App URL configuration in Custom Apps is a common issue.

## Method 1: Look in Different Sections

### Step 1: Check All Tabs
In your Custom App, check these tabs in order:

1. **"App setup"** tab
2. **"Configuration"** tab  
3. **"Setup"** tab
4. **"URLs"** tab
5. **"App URLs"** tab
6. **"Webhooks"** tab

### Step 2: Check Main App Page
Sometimes the URL configuration is on the main app page, not in tabs:
- Look for fields like "App URL" or "Redirect URL"
- Look for sections labeled "URLs" or "Configuration"
- Look for "App proxy" settings

### Step 3: Check App Installation Section
- Look for "Installation" or "Install" section
- Check for "App proxy" configuration
- Look for "Public app" settings

## Method 2: Check App Type

### Custom Apps vs Partners Apps
- **Custom Apps** (created in Shopify Admin) have limited configuration options
- **Partners Apps** (created in Partners Dashboard) have more configuration options
- **App URL** might not be available in all Custom App types

### If App URL is Missing
This is common in Custom Apps. The solution is often to:
1. Create a new Custom App with proper configuration
2. Or use Partners Dashboard to create the app

## Method 3: Alternative Configuration

### If You Can't Find App URL Configuration
Some Custom Apps don't have App URL configuration. In this case:

1. **Use OAuth without App URL**
   - Set redirect_uri directly in OAuth URL
   - Don't rely on App URL configuration

2. **Use Static Access Token**
   - Skip OAuth entirely
   - Use Admin API access token directly
   - Configure webhooks via GraphQL API

## Method 4: Create New Custom App

### Recommended Solution
Since finding App URL in existing Custom Apps is problematic:

1. **Create new Custom App** in Shopify Admin
2. **Configure URLs properly** from the start
3. **Get new API credentials**
4. **Update environment variables**

## Method 5: Check App Installation

### Alternative Location
Sometimes App URL is configured during installation:
1. Go to **Apps** ‚Üí **App and sales channel settings**
2. Look for your app in **"Installed apps"**
3. Click on it and look for URL settings
4. Check for "App proxy" or "Public app" configuration

## What to Look For

### App URL Configuration Fields
- **App URL** or **Application URL**
- **Allowed redirection URL(s)**
- **Redirect URI**
- **App proxy URL**
- **Public app URL**

### Save Button
- Look for **"Save"** or **"Update"** button
- Configuration changes must be saved
- Some changes require app restart

## Common Issues

### App URL Not Available
- Some Custom Apps don't support App URL configuration
- This is a limitation of certain app types
- Solution: Create new app or use alternative methods

### Configuration Not Saving
- Check if you have proper permissions
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Try refreshing the page after saving

### OAuth Still Failing
- Even with correct App URL, OAuth can fail
- Check scopes are correct
- Verify redirect_uri matches exactly
- Consider using static access token instead

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try to find App URL** using methods above
2. **If not found**, create new Custom App
3. **If found but OAuth still fails**, use static access token
4. **Configure webhooks** via GraphQL API after authentication works
